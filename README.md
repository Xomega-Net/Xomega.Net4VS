# Xomega platform community

The current repository hosts issues, questions, discussions and feature requests for the Xomega.Net low-code development platform.

## What is Xomega.Net platform

Xomega.Net is a low-code platform tageted for .NET developers that allows you to quickly create, model and generate data-driven .NET web or desktop applications.

The platform consists of the following components:

- [Visual Studio extension](https://xomega.net/docs/visual-studio/overview) with a solution wizard for your target architecture(s), and a special project for modeling your application.
- [Xomega Generators](https://xomega.net/docs/generators/overview) for generating (and regenerating!) all application layers and UI views using architecture best practices.
- Open-source [Xomega Framework](https://github.com/Xomega-Net/XomegaFramework) that powers the generated application, and helps you to write clean, reusable and maintainable code. 

💡 Tip: you can even use Xomega Framework in your application as Nuget packages independently of the rest of the Xomega platform.
